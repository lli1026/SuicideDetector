    "\n",
    "The dataset is a collection of posts from the \"SuicideWatch\" and \"depression\" subreddits of the Reddit platform. The posts are collected using Pushshift API. All posts that were made to \"SuicideWatch\" from Dec 16, 2008(creation) till Jan 2, 2021, were collected while \"depression\" posts were collected from Jan 1, 2009, to Jan 2, 2021. All posts collected from SuicideWatch are labeled as suicide, While posts collected from the depression subreddit are labeled as depression. Non-suicide posts are collected from r/teenagers.\n",

    "The current version has only suicide & non-suicide labels. \n",

    "#### Steps Taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Explore and Preprodessing\n",
    "1. load data, sample data for the purpose of computer power issue\n",
    "2. Explore the data shape, null value, classes\n",
    "3. Remove punctuation, remove stop words\n",
    "4. Map the classes to 0 and 1\n",
    "5. Find the most common words used for suicide and non-suicide group\n",
    "##### Create Model, model compile, model training\n",
    "1. building a model including a embedding layer,a LSTM layer, a dense layer for output\n",
    "2. complile: use BinaryCrossentropy as loss, accuracy as metrics, Adam as optimizer\n",
    "##### Model Optimization: Steps taken to overcome overfitting\n",
    "1. increase data size from 12000 to 50000\n",
    "2. reduce model complexity (reduce the number of LSTM units from 64 to 16; reduce embedding dimension from 64 to 16\n",
    "3. Regularization: add l2 regularization to the LSTM layer, value from 0.01 to 0.04, dropout from 0.1 to 0.8; add drop out layers after LSTM layer, value from 0.5 to 0.8\n",
    "4. Batch Normalization: add batch normalization layers after LSTM layer\n",
    "5. Early stopping\n",
    "6. Learning Rate Scheduling (initial lr from 0.01 change to 0.001)"

The word \"depression\" has seemingly lost its value over the past couple years because it seems like everyone has it now. And whether that's true or not, it's not taken as seriously as it should. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for about 3 years and I've personally decided I cannot deal with this shit for one more fucking second. Not only does my depression put me in a constant loop of suicidal thoughts and despair, but it also pisses me off. I've had anger issues since I was a little kid and I've been taking meds for them for years and years and years now and those don't seem to helping, so I've been giving this whole thing some thought for quite some time now and I came to the conclusion that I don't understand who I am or what I'm doing here, and for that I don't enjoy life. To be more specific, nothing brings me joy anymore. I don't like video games, I don't like food, I don't like people, I don't like sleeping, I don't like being awake, I don't like my home, I don't like traveling, I don't like anything. I don't even like my own family. \\nA while back I figured out the meaning of life. (My meaning at least) to enjoy life. And I've realized that I just can't do that because I just don't like shit. I thought maybe one day this would end but it just seems to be getting worse. And I know everyone says that and also everyone says things get better, which I believe, but I don't care. I can't live like this any longer. I can't even cry. I've become so numb to the pain where I feel like I'm a fucking robot and all the emotions I feel are just in my head. Not to mention my thinking process. Anytime anything ever happens, I think to myself; is this worth being here for? And the answer is almost always no. In the midst of all of this I believe I was given a sign, I lost my job, my only friend and my girlfriend in one week. I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I don't like being alive but I just can't seem to kill myself. I wake up believing I exist for the sole purpose of being tortured every living second. This is my personal hell.\\n\\nPlease, someone save me. Leave a tip, a suggestion, anything. I'm about to give up. I can't take being alive much longer.</td>\n",

Months self harm free and the urge just gets stronger and stronger every day. The past few days I've just been shit... \\nMy family stresses me out especially my nephew (he's 12) My mum has full custody of him and he's told me to go kill myself numerous times.. I wish it was that easy.\\nMy partners family stresses me out especially over the past few days. \\nStress is my trigger \\nI just want to scream and cry. \\nI live near the woods so I could go out and scream till I can't possibly scream anymore but the cops will probably get called...\\nMy OH knows about my depression but he doesn't really know how I'm feeling at the moment. He would want to come over and make sure I'm OK but he's fucking annoying. He annoys me all the time by doing small stupid things. \\nI don't even know where I'm going with the post? \\n\\n   \n",

I can sometimes like hear my brain speaking to me ''hey.. heyy those people are fake dont talk to them''. So far the only thing that helps is music, but thats kinda stopping to work. I have 2 really fucking good friends and I don't deserve them. Nobody needs a suicidal fucktard who can't help you, who just pushes you away. What use am I to anyone? I barely do anything useful with my life. People say ''what about your loved ones?'' well if I've been fucking abused I don't really think that makes a difference except for my father whos actually fine, out of all my family he is the only one I'd feel about for having to suffer. I don't see a point in hanging on anymore. I'll never get better and I dont want to feel guilty by committing suicide. It is very hard for me to get help and I really don't see how I'm gonna get out of this. I feel like I'm just gonna off myself before I'm even 18. I don't want anyone to feel bad for me, I deserve all of this regardless   \n",

       "162854  I dont want to die but I dont want to liveI've rewritten this about 4 times now and I just don't know how to put it into words. The word \"depression\" has seemingly lost its value over the past couple years because it seems like everyone has it now. And whether that's true or not, it's not taken as seriously as it should. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for about 3 years and I've personally decided I cannot deal with this shit for one more fucking second. Not only does my depression put me in a constant loop of suicidal thoughts and despair, but it also pisses me off. I've had anger issues since I was a little kid and I've been taking meds for them for years and years and years now and those don't seem to helping, so I've been giving this whole thing some thought for quite some time now and I came to the conclusion that I don't understand who I am or what I'm doing here, and for that I don't enjoy life. To be more specific, nothing brings me joy anymore. I don't like video games, I don't like food, I don't like people, I don't like sleeping, I don't like being awake, I don't like my home, I don't like traveling, I don't like anything. I don't even like my own family. \\nA while back I figured out the meaning of life. (My meaning at least) to enjoy life. And I've realized that I just can't do that because I just don't like shit. I thought maybe one day this would end but it just seems to be getting worse. And I know everyone says that and also everyone says things get better, which I believe, but I don't care. I can't live like this any longer. I can't even cry. I've become so numb to the pain where I feel like I'm a fucking robot and all the emotions I feel are just in my head. Not to mention my thinking process. Anytime anything ever happens, I think to myself; is this worth being here for? And the answer is almost always no. In the midst of all of this I believe I was given a sign, I lost my job, my only friend and my girlfriend in one week. I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I don't like being alive but I just can't seem to kill myself. I wake up believing I exist for the sole purpose of being tortured every living second. This is my personal hell.\\n\\nPlease, someone save me. Leave a tip, a suggestion, anything. I'm about to give up. I can't take being alive much longer.   \n",

I have friends, yet always feel lonely, and there aren't any problems at my house. I just want to stop living, and I've never been as close as today. I'm probably not depressed, I just feel a permanent sadness in my life, like every day is just a net loss for everyone around me, including me\\n   \n",
